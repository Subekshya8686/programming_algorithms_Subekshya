//You are the captain of a spaceship and you have been assigned a mission to explore a distant galaxy. Your
//spaceship is equipped with a set of engines, where each engine represented by a block. Each engine requires a
//specific amount of time to be built and can only be built by one engineer.
//Your task is to determine the minimum time needed to build all the engines using the available engineers. The
//engineers can either work on building an engine or split into two engineers, with each engineer sharing the
//workload equally. Both decisions incur a time cost.
//The time cost of splitting one engineer into two engineers is given as an integer split. Note that if two engineers
//split at the same time, they split in parallel so the cost would be split.
//Your goal is to calculate the minimum time needed to build all the engines, considering the time cost of splitting
//engineers.
//Input: engines= [1,2,3]
//Split cost (k)=1
//Output: 4
//Example:
//Imagine you need to build engine represented by an array [1,2,3]   where ith element of an array i.e a[i] represents
//unit time to build ith engine and the split cost is 1. Initially, there is only one engineer available.
//The optimal strategy is as follows:
//1. The engineer splits into two engineers, increasing the total count to two. (Split Time: 1) and assign first
//engineer to build third engine i.e. which will take 3 unit of time.
//2. Again, split second engineer into two (split time :1) and assign them to build first and second engine
//respectively.
//Therefore, the minimum time needed to build all the engines using optimal decisions on splitting engineers and
//assigning them to engines. =1+ max (3, 1 + max (1, 2)) = 4.
//Note: The splitting process occurs in parallel, and the goal is to minimize the total time required to build all the
//engines using the available engineers while considering the time cost of splitting.
